QUESTIONS FOR CHRIS
-------------------
The spell points seem wrong compared to steem. E.g. Zothen has 43 sp in ours, and 21 in original, and Megrim has 0 spell points. Anything we missed? - Not sure about this maybe we need to rip the ingame stats instead
When a champ deals damage, do all champions in player team get the same amount of xp per hit, per champ? Or only the champ that deals the damage?
