QUESTIONS FOR CHRIS
-------------------
What are the dungeon codes for mindrock, formwall, firepath and concealed shelf?
We need to map the 4 symbols of each spell to their corresponding character in the font list. First symbol will then be 0. I believe there are around 26 characters?
What happens if i drop keys or coins on the floor/shelf, on top of other keys/coins? Do they merge?
