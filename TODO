QUESTIONS FOR CHRIS
-------------------
When a champ deals damage, do all champions in player team get the same amount of xp per hit, per champ? Or only the champ that deals the damage?
Need to know how the crystals work on paths and triggers in Zendik's end floor
How does Behemoth spawn?
How do items drop from Behemoth and Zendik?
I need to know some easy-to-find (big or summon) monster positions, and their form on the allMonsters list. E.g. all first monsters of every tower. Basically i need to know what formId matches what level of the big monster.
