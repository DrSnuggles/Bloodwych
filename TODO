QUESTIONS FOR CHRIS
-------------------
End chamber: which crystal makes Behemoth spawn in the middle?
How do items drop from Behemoth and Zendik?
I need to know some easy-to-find (big or summon) monster positions, and their form/colour on the allMonsters list. E.g. all first monsters of every tower. Basically i need to know what formId/colour matches what level of the big monster.
