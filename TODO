QUESTIONS FOR CHRIS
-------------------
When a champ deals damage, do all champions in player team get the same amount of xp per hit, per champ? Or only the champ that deals the damage?
End chamber: when we put the crystals in the sockets, do we get teleported?
End chamber: when we put the crystals in the sockets, do they stick or can they be removed again?
End chamber: which crystal makes Behemoth spawn in the middle?
How do items drop from Behemoth and Zendik?
I need to know some easy-to-find (big or summon) monster positions, and their form/colour on the allMonsters list. E.g. all first monsters of every tower. Basically i need to know what formId/colour matches what level of the big monster.
