QUESTIONS FOR JORG
------------------
1. Need to try link a text to a screen (fairy)
2. I have all the spell descriptions but not sure how to add them to your spell object
	In initSpells(), extend new Spell with the proper parameters: new Spell(id, name, description, prof, level, cost);
3. need a function to return the next two spells available for a champ
4. Need to work out how we are going to store all this text I have found :)
