WOULDST THOU RIP ME OFF
I NEVER TRUST THE UNNATURAL
KEEP TALKING AND WE'LL SEE
I THINK NOT MY FRIEND
MY NAME IS NOT IMPORTANT
I AM ZENDIK THE MASTER OF CREATION
METHINKS THOU ART TOO GREEDY

THAT'S VERY POSSIBLE
I CANNOT BUT AGREE
THAT SEEMS VERY LIKELY
I'M NOT ABOUT TO ARGUE WITH THEE
I DON'T KEEP COMPANY WITH MAGGOTS
LOOK TO THE TOWERS MY FRIEND
INDEED NOT

PICK ON SOMEONE THY OWN SIZE THOU SLUG
I AM THY WORST NIGHTMARE
NONE OF THY BUSINESS I'M SURE

NEWS IS SCARCE IN THESE PARTS
I HEAR CRYSTALS ARE WORTH SEEKING
WHO CAN SAY WHAT IS OF NOTE?
I HEAR ZENDIK IS NOT WHOLLY A WORM

I DO NOT TRADE IN TRINKETS
I NEED NOT THY TRASH

MAYBE TRUE BUT THOU SHOULD BE SO LUCKY
I TRUST THIS PLEASES THEE

HAST HEARD OF ANY POWERFUL BEINGS?
