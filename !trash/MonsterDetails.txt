Hacking : Monster Data Structure


In the game binary, information about the monsters is stored in batch by tower. 

There are 6 digits in BW which mark the number of monsters per tower at [$171F4]


As raw data these can be found as:

                00 48 00 4D 00 53 00 43 00 4F 00 4D


This is followed by 300 byte blocks, each containing the detailed information about the monsters, at the following locations;

                [$17200] The Keep
                [$17500] The Serpent Tower
                [$17800] The Moon Tower
                [$17B00] The Dragon Tower
                [$17E00] The Chaos Tower
                [$18100] Zendik's Tower


At these locations, you find the monster data stored in 6 byte blocks. 

As an example. the following shows you the data for the first 8 monsters in The Keep.

                04 0B 0F 00 15 FF
                04 16 1A 00 16 FF
                05 02 00 04 15 FF
                04 0F 0F 00 2F FF
                14 03 09 00 11 FF
                04 06 00 01 14 FF
                04 06 01 00 14 FF
                04 06 03 01 14 FF


By breaking this down by byte we can begin to understand what this data represents;

                AB CD EF GH IJ KL


A = Type of Monster
    
     This can be one of three values; 
     0 - Normal Fighting Monster
     1 - Spell-casting Monster
     3 - Arc Bolt Machine

B - The number of the tower floor on which the monster starts.

CD - The X-coordinate postiioning of the tower floor on which the monster starts. 

However, if between two and four monsters are to start in the same location (teamed) this number is left void and given a value of FF on the second to fourth team-members.

EF - The Y-coordinate positioning of the tower floor on which the monster starts. 

GH - The level of the monster. This determines the monsters strength, speed, available spells, and for non-humanoid monsters also the colour of the monster.

In the Extended Levels Vol.1 this also acts as a seed number to help generate the monster's name 

IJ - This is the form / look of the monster. This number represents those given in the monster lookup table.

KL - This is the rather unusual "team-data" number. In the majority of cases this is left blank with the value of FF.
However, when two monsters are to begin the game "teamed" with the same starting postion, this value simple increases from 00 and beyond, for every teamed-monster.

For example, two monsters both placed at X04 Y06 would have the team-data values of 00 and 01 respectively, and this would continue with the next two teamed monsters in the list having the values of 02 and 03.
